# PYTHON SCRIPT FOR RENAMING FILES

the stock sd card of the anbernic rg35xx has approximately 5000 games in it with numbers on the start of it's file name, making Skraper (a software for scraping boxarts of roms) unable to scrape the images needed of the roms.

This script removes the digits at the beginning of the file name so that Skraper can find the game's box art.
